#100DaysOfSwiftUI - Project 17 - FlashZilla - a question and answer flash card app

This was another super-sized project, but also another one where we covered some really great techniques like gestures, haptics, Combine, and more. When these features work together we can do remarkable things in our apps, providing an experience to users that is seamless and delightful.

You also see once again the importance of ensuring accessibility in our apps. It’s easy to get carried away with cool gestures and more, but then forget that straying from standard UI also means we need to up our game when it comes to VoiceOver and more. Anyone can make a good idea, but to make a great app means you’ve taken into account the needs of everyone.
